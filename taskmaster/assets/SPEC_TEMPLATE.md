# Task Specification

> Frozen after user approval. Changes require explicit re-approval.

## Goals
<!-- What are we building? Be specific and concrete. -->

-

## Non-Goals
<!-- What are we explicitly NOT doing? Prevents scope creep. -->

-

## Constraints
<!-- Tech stack, style guide, performance limits, compatibility requirements -->

-

## Environment
<!-- Auto-filled by agent at init time -->

- **Project root**: `<auto>`
- **Language/runtime**: `<auto>`
- **Package manager**: `<auto>`
- **Test framework**: `<auto>`
- **Build command**: `<auto>`
- **Existing test count**: `<auto>`

## Risk Assessment
<!-- Identify potential blockers or unknowns before starting -->

- [ ] External dependencies (APIs, services) — availability confirmed?
- [ ] Breaking changes to existing code — impact assessed?
- [ ] Large file generation — disk space sufficient?
- [ ] Long-running tests — timeout configured?

## Deliverables
<!-- Concrete outputs: files, features, endpoints, docs -->

-

## Done-When
<!-- Final acceptance criteria. The task is DONE when ALL of these pass. -->

- [ ]

## Final Validation Command
<!-- Single command that validates the entire deliverable. Runs at close-out. -->

```bash
# e.g.: npm run build && npm test && npm run lint
```

## Demo Flow (optional)
<!-- Step-by-step instructions to demonstrate the finished product. -->
